<!-- In this exercise, I spent a lot of time on study javascript and tried a lot. 
    The final presentation is the content of music video implemented with a custom control bar.
  According to the relevant tutorials in MDN, I added volume control, full screen and multi speed buttons. 
  I did show and hide details for all three control bars.
  The full screen button is an essential function in the video player. 
  Users can get different listening experiences through the speed multiplying button, and can also view all the content in the video more simply and quickly by customizing the speed. 
  In consideration of the user experience, I also added a loop button and a replay button at the end.-->
